	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I love creating. It is what inspires me as a musician, developer, and leader. Ever since I was a kid, I have loved creative flow, something I feel when I lose track of time working on an awesome project. 

	As a developer, I have enjoyed working on both low and high-level systems. I have extensive experience working on frontend and full stack projects in my internships, while at school I have additionally worked on lower levels including designing a processor, writing a file system, and working with embedded systems. I have had the opportunity to design systems and lead technical projects, especially as I have become a stronger developer.

	As a musician, I have worked on many types of projects. One of my most notable contributions was a musical that I wrote and put on for my senior thesis. At about an hour-and-a-half, this South Park-inspired comedy was one of the most fun (and most difficult) experiences I’ve ever had. I wrote the music, the script, and designed the sound effects. I also produced an original cast album and ran some of the practices. Additionally, I’ve been active as a front man in my band, Fat Jimmy, playing around Charlottesville.
