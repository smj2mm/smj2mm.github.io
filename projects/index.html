        <h3> StadivaRIOs – Senior Capstone Project </h3>
	The StradivaRIOs is a proof-of-concept physical digital audio controller that emulates the way multiple instruments are played in different modes of operation. This controller communicates with a computer to produce sound. In order to interface with a user, two different sensors are used: an infrared distance sensor (IR sensor) to track the distance from a user’s hand to the device, and an array of capacitive touch sensors which function like a touchscreen. This data is then transformed into a protocol called Open Sound Control (OSC) within a National Instruments myRIO microcontroller. Finally, data from the myRIO is sent via UDP (User Datagram Protocol) packets over a private network to a laptop computer, which processes the data in a sound synthesis program to produce audio signals.
